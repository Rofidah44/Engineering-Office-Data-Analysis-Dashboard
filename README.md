# Engineering Office Data Analysis Dashboard

## Project Objective

To analyze data related to engineering offices, providing insights into their distribution, classification, and contact information across various cities. This dashboard also facilitates easy searching for specific offices, cities, or other criteria.

## Dataset Used

**Dataset:** Engineering Offices Data

This dataset contains information about engineering offices, including their ID, city, name, classification degree, contact details (mobile, email, website), and address.

## Key Questions (KPIs)

*   Distribution of engineering offices by classification degree.
*   Comparison of engineering offices across different cities and classification degrees.
*   Identification of top-tier engineering offices (e.g., classification degree 1-3).
*   Number of engineering offices per city for specific classification degrees.
*   Availability of contact information (e.g., email, website) for engineering offices.

## Process

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Obtained the "Engineering Offices Data" CSV file.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Reviewed data for structure and content, noting Arabic column names.
3.  **Dashboard Analysis:** Interpreted the Arabic dashboard PDF to understand key visualizations and metrics.
4.  **README Generation:** Synthesized information to create a concise English README.
